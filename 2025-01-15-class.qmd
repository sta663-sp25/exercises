## Exercise 1

* Create a list containing tuples of x and y coordinates of all points of a regular grid for $x \in [0,10]$ and $y \in [0,10]$.

```{python}
g = [(x,y) for x in range(11) for y in range(11)]
len(g)
```

* Count the number of points where $y>x$.

```{python}
len([(x,y) for x,y in g if y > x])
len([(x,y) for x in range(11) for y in range(11) if y > x])
```

* Count the number of points $x$ or $y$ is prime.

```{python}
prime = [2,3,5,7]
[(x,y) for x,y in g if x in prime or y in prime]
```


## Exercise 2

1. Write a function, kg_to_lb, that converts a list of weights in kilograms to a list of weights in pounds (there a 1 kg = 2.20462 lbs). Include a doc string and function annotations.

```{python}
def kg_to_lb(wt: list) -> list:
    "Convert weight in kgs to weight in lbs"

    return [x * 2.20462 for x in wt]

kg_to_lb([1,2,3])
```

2. Write a second function, total_lb, that calculates the total weight in pounds of an order, the input arguments should be a list of item weights in kilograms and a list of the number of each item ordered.

```{python}
def total_lb(wt: list, n: list) -> float:
    "Calculate the total weight of items in lbs from kg and n"

    if (len(n) == 1):
        n = n*len(wt)

    if (len(n) != len(wt)):
        raise ValueError("Length of weight and n do not match")
 
    return sum([x*y*2.20462 for x,y in zip(wt, n)])

total_lb([1,2,3],[2,2])
```
